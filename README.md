# 🐍 Sneaky Snake Game  

Welcome to **Sneaky Snake**, a modern take on the classic Snake game!  
This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and includes exciting features to enhance your gaming experience.  

The game is called *Sneaky Snake* because of the snake's ability to slip through walls and appear on the opposite side – a sneaky maneuver that adds a strategic element to the classic gameplay.
